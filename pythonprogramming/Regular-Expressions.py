"""
You can create a raw string in Python by prefixing a string literal with r or R. 
Python raw string treats the backslash character '(\)' as a literal character. 
Raw string is useful when a string needs to contain a backslash, 
such as for a regular expression or Windows directory path, 
and you donâ€™t want it to be treated as an escape character.
